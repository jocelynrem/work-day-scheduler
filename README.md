# Work Day Scheduler

A simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day.

## How it Works

On open: Current day is displayed at top
Scroll down: timeblocks for standard business hours
timeblocks: color coded for past, present, future
Click on timeblock: enter event, save event in local storage
on refresh: saved items are still there
Uses a date utility library to work with date and time
